Stable release of ConsoleKit2

This is the first release of ConsoleKit2 considered stable. It
incorporates many changes since the fork from ConsoleKit. Please
see the previous development release notes for the full list of

Only one commit with this release but since it changes the
public DBUS API it's better to get it out now before someone
starts writing for the 0.9.0 APIs.

Hybrid Suspend has been added as a sleep method. The sleep
API has been reworked to emulate logind so that supporting
both is easier.

GNU/kFreeBSD provided to the ConsoleKit bugtracker or on distro's
public repositories. As well as many other patches floating around
so that distributions no longer have to carry large patchsets.
Please report any other patches required or currently in use and
those can be added as well.

The 63 threads issue has been resolved if the Linux kernel has
support for the notification required.

DragonFlyBSD, and OpenBSD through a DBUS API.
