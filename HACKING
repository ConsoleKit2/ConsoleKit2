Making Changes
==============

Please send all patches (in unified diff form) to the HAL mailing list:
http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/hal

All patches should be against the latest version (see Source Code
Repository).


Source Code Repository
======================

 - anonymous checkouts

   $ git clone git://git.freedesktop.org/git/ConsoleKit

 - checkouts if you have an ssh account on fd.o (username@ is optional)

   $ git clone ssh://[username@]git.freedesktop.org/git/ConsoleKit

 - commit to local repository

   $ git commit -a

 - push local repository to master repository at fd.o (remember most patches
   requires review at the mailing list)

   $ git push

 - pull changes from master repository at fd.o

   $ git pull

 - diff of working tree versus local repository

   $ git diff

 - diff of local repository vs. master repository at fd.o

   synchronize with upstream repo:
   $ git pull

   (possibly merge changes)

   generate the diff:
   $ git diff origin HEAD

 - influential environment variables (set these in e.g. .bash_profile)

   export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME='Your Full Name'
   export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME='Your Full Name'
   export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=youremail@domain.net
   export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=youremail@domain.net

Committing Code
===============

 - Commit messages should be of the form (the five lines between the
   lines starting with ===)

=== begin example commit ===
short explanation of the commit

Longer explanation explaining exactly what's changed, whether any
external or private interfaces changed, what bugs were fixed (with bug
tracker reference if applicable) and so forth. Be concise but not too brief.
=== end example commit ===

 - Always add a brief description of the commit to the _first_ line of
   the commit and terminate by two newlines (it will work without the
   second newline, but that is not nice for the interfaces).

 - First line (the brief description) must only be one sentence and
   must not start with a capital letter. Don't use a trailing period
   either.

 - The main description (the body) is normal prose and should use normal
   punctuation and capital letters where appropriate. Normally, for patches
   sent to a mailing list it's copied from there.

 - When committing code on behalf of others use the --author option, e.g.
   git commit -a --author "Joe Coder <joe@coder.org>"


Coding Style
============

 - Follow the coding style already used

 - Write docs for all functions and structs and so on. We use gtkdoc format.
